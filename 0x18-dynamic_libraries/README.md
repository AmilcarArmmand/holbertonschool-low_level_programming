## Description  :books:

In this project, we learned how to create and use a dynamic library using the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and the nm, ldd, and ldconfig commands.

## Project tasks  :computer:

---

### [0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life](./libholberton.so)
* Create the dynamic library libholberton.so containing all the functions listed below:


### [1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future](./1-create_dynamic_lib.sh)
* Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.


### [2. Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing](./100-operations.so)
* Write a blog post describing the differences between static and dynamic libraries. It should cover:


### [3. Let's call C functions from Python](./101-make_me_win.sh)
* I know, you’re missing C when coding in Python. So let’s fix that!
